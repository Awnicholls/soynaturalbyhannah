## Headless E-Commerce site - https://soynaturalbyhannah.co.uk/
Users can view products, choose 2 options for each products, a scent type and a product variation. Once added to cart, users can change the quantity of products they have before checking out. In the checkout they can choose which shipping method they would like, then finally pay through stripe. An email is sent with a reciept and product list summary, as well as a follow up email when the products are shipped.

You can check out the LIVE project [**HERE**](https://soynaturalbyhannah.co.uk/ 'Completed project').

### Motivation

The primary motive was to try out and learn both **Redux** and **Material-UI**. I also thought an headless e-commerce project would be an
interesting and difficult undertaking in general. 
All data was added to commerce.js and is fully customiseable, taken from a real store (with permission)
[**SoyNaturalByHannah**](https://soynaturalbyhannah.co.uk/ 'Original Store').

In addition, an eccomerce site has many possible imporements and can be changed and made better over time.
Some of the things I would like to redo, as this was my first big react project, is to use context over
prop drilling, to better integrate redux, allow for more or less variations on the products, for a start.

### Technologies used:

- **ReactJS**
- **CommerceJS** for products hosting and cart/checkout api
- **Stripe** for payment
- **Redux** for state management
- **Material-UI** for styling and components
- **React Router** for routing

---

### Challenges:

Using an api and calling it for the products and checkout/cart process
was intimidating at first, but commerce.js makes it so easy to integrate it
into your project.

material ui was my first UI framework. Using it to implement components and their styling made everything much easier, and allowed me to focus on how the store worked moreso than how it looked.

### Future

I will be revising this as my skills in react, redux and frameworks that could improve the project increase. There are a couple of errors that I still need to fix, but I am happy with how the site works and functions as is at the moment so they will be addressed in the future through branches.
